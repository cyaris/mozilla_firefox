SQL project for General Assembly Data Analytics course, Spring 2017. Queried survey data to group by each user's response to a single question.

The queried survey data restructured the table so that each column represented a possible answer to a given question. This improved the original format which displayed all given answers for a particular question in a single cell. In doing so, it enabled for users to be compared by each possible question answer, rather than a single combination of answers.
